# Can you run a database on Kubernetes?

Yes you can most databases do provide container images. Although the question is why do you want to run databases on kubernetes.
 - It is great for dev environments.
 - It is great for testing.
Basically you spin it up with a given dataset, and if it disapears you are fine with it.
